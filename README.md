# Eppstein's Algorithm: A Sonnet

In paths that wind through weighted graphs so vast,  
Where vertices and edges lay entwined,  
Doth Eppstein's method stand steadfast,  
To find the k-best routes one seeks to find.

With heaps of heaps, a structure most divine,  
It builds a tree of paths with careful art,  
Each branch explored in order, line by line,  
Revealing shortcuts hidden from the start.

O! Graph theoretic wonder of our time,  
That solves what Dijkstra's method cannot see,  
The second, third, and fourth best paths sublime,  
Arranged in order of their gravity.

Though complex be the code that brings it life,  
Its elegance doth end the searcher's strife.
